------------------------------------------

> Some programs that exemplify different algorithms developed in assembler thinking of a MIPS architecture with the MARS simulator. The content of this repository is detailed below.

## Small Functions

0. The function return the minor element of the array.
1. The function return the amount of capital or lowercase letters.
2. The function return the number of words even and the number of odd words.
3.The function calculate 2's complement.

## Small Programs

1. Algorithm that works on words, regarding upper and lower case, is found in: Upper_Lower_case_program.s
2. Algorithm for a recursive function of C(n,k), found at: RecursiveCnk.s
3. Algorithm for calculating the arithmetic average, is found in: arithmeticAverage.s
4. Algorithm where the multiplication function is developed using the ALU digital circuit: Mult_Unsigned.s
5. Algorithm where the division function is developed using the ALU digital circuit: Divu_Unsigned.s
