# It is for a MIPS architecture
# Different actions are implemented in a
# unicycle processor


#******************************************************
#  CLOCK PERIOD
#******************************************************
# The added times are presented in the diagram in the
# results folder under the name of clk_period.png
# The calculation of the clock period for the unicycle
# processor with the latency times, is given by:
# add + alu + data_memory = total_period
# 500 ns + 200 ns + 600 ns = 1300 ns

#******************************************************
#  CLOCK PERIOD
# PLUS PIPELINE OF FIVE STAGES
#******************************************************
# The clock period if a 5-stage pipeline is implemented
# with the defined times is given by the following line
# of thought.At this stage, what is considered is the
# module that takes the longest to execute (latency time)
# plus a pipeline time. Since the idea is to stabilize
# considering the execution time of the modules.

# The module with the longest latency time is the data_memory,
# so 600 ns plus the pipeline time are considered (which
# is 6 ns), resulting in a clock period of 606 ns.

# It is important to consider that the latency times are
# found in the docs folder in the image of latencies.png
# and in the image of the datapath.png they are entered
# on each module.

#******************************************************
#  CLOCK PERIOD
# SINGLE INSTRUCTION AND PIPELINE
#******************************************************
# Below is the necessary to calculate the duration in the
# execution of a single instruction if a 5-stage pipeline
# is implemented. Considering that all the stages have to
# last the same, the slowest stage is taken in this case
# is the data_memory stage plus the pipeline and if it
# multiplies by 5 since there are 5 stages. Allowing all
# stages to last as long as the slowest stage lasts. So:

# 606 ns * 5 = 3030 ns

#******************************************************
# POWER CONSUMPTION
# OF THE SW $RT, INM($RS)
#******************************************************
# About the power consumption of the sw $ Rt, Inm ($ Rs)
# instruction in the unicycle processor.
# The path is followed until completing the sw instruction
# which happens in the data_memory where it passes through
# the path which is seen in the image energy_consumption.png
# plus the consideration of the energy of the read and write
# pipeline.

# Instruction memory + pipeline write + pipeline read +
# register write + register read + alu + data_memory write

# 55 + 20 + 10 + 12 + 10 + 2 + 120 = 229 pJ

#******************************************************
# INT PART OF SQRT(NUMBER) IN MARS - MIPS
#******************************************************
# The integer part of the square root of a number is
# calculated by counting the number of odd numbers
# (in ascending order) that can be subtracted from
# the base number.
###### example given 34 = 0x22
### 1: left 33   = 0x21
### 3: left 30 = 0x1e
### 5: left 25 = 0x19
### 7: left 18 = 0x12
### 9: left 9 = 0x9
### 11: Can't because result<0
# int part = 5

# MACHINE LANGUAGE
#******************************************************

# The machine language encoding of the program must
# obtain the value of 32 bits. For each instruction,
# all the values of the control signals of the unicycle
# processor are determined, as well as the ALU signals.
# It is determined if there are data and control risks
# in the program carried out and when to forward or stop
# the pipeline.
